## Hello, my name is Luciana! :wave:

Having accumulated 10 years of experience in technology project management, I am truly passionate about continually expanding my knowledge and skills. 
Currently, I am enrolled as a student in the NExT Course at Cesar School, where I am dedicated to learning how to develop software. 

This journey not only enhances my existing expertise but also opens up exciting possibilities for professional growth and exploration. I am enthusiastic about embracing new challenges and broadening my horizons in the dynamic world of technology.
